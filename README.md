# Loan Default Prediction & Expected Loss Estimation

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using machine learning models. It also estimates the expected financial loss associated with defaulting loans. The project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques in Python.
